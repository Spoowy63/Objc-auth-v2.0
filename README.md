# Objc-auth-v2.0

## HOW TO USE:
* **first make sure the digits and the math are the same as the ones in the Objc auth code or else the keys will be invalid**
* copy the file **Key_Generator.py** and run it. it will ask for the ID
* paste the ID that the user sent you.
* Done. you should now have gotten the key and only thing left to do is sending it to that same user. repeat the previous step for each user

## EXTRA INFO:
Objc auth v1.0 uses a password and username that everyone can use. This however uses an ID method which will be different for each user so other users won't be able to use it without you giving them a key

***it is possible to bypass this auth. same goes for almost any other auth use at your own risk***
