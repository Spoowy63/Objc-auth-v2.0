4. if youre using your own project just paste it wherever you want

### how to use the Key_Generator.py file: 
1. **first make sure the digits and the math are the same in the *.xm* file and the *Key_Generator.py* or else the keys will be invalid**
2. now download Python3IDE from the appstore: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/python3ide/id1357215444
3. copy the file **Key_Generator.py**, create a new ***.py*** in Python3IDE ans paste **Key_Generator.py** in it. Now run it. it will ask for the ID
4. paste the ID that the user sent you and tap enter.
5. Done. you should now have gotten the key and the only thing left to do is sending it to that same user. repeat step 1-5 for each user

## EXTRA INFO:
Objc auth v1.0 uses a password and username that everyone can use. This however uses an ID method which will be different for each user so other users won't be able to use it without you giving them a key

***it is possible to bypass this auth. same goes for almost any other auth use at your own risk***
